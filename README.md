# Twitch-chatbot

A "twitchplays" chatbot implemented for [TwitchPlaysYourGame](www.twitch.tv/TwitchPlaysYourGame) using Java and PircBot.

This was a project made for fun that went live in the summer of 2016.

### Twitch
Twitch is a streaming platform where people broadcast live playing games.
### "TwitchPlays"
Someone eventually got the idea to allow stream viewers to interact directly with the game via chat.
### The Project
TwitchPlaysYourGame was a project to not only let viewers play the game via chat, but also let them choose which game they would play.

It had a peak of 40 viewers simutaneously, and many fun memories were created.

Here you can see some of the recordings from the stream: https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplaysyourgame/videos/all
